I used JDBC and set it up just like how the professor did in his video. The only difference comes from the code itself. 

After creating the students table in the database using TableCreation.sql (my database's name is University), you can populate the table with TablePopulate.sql.

After that, you can execute each function in the code one by one and check the database to see if the function is correct.
